# android-duallogin
A simple login screen with options to use a stored Google account or login credentials

## Installation

1. Download "DualLogin.apk" file onto an Android device
2. Make sure "Unknown Sources" setting is turned on, so that you are allowed to install an unsigned APK.
3. Open the APK file on the Android device
4. Follow the installation instructions

## Usage

When testing the google account sign in, you will need to have an account already set up.
However, if you don't already have an account linked on the device, the popup that displays upon hitting the Google Account button will allow you to link up a new or existing Google account!

## History

This project was built so that anyone could easily start from with a baseline, generic login screen.
I want to make it easy so that other Android developers don't have to reinvent the wheel.
If other developers can use this sample to speed up their production of their own Android application, then the purpose of this project will be fulfilled.
